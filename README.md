# Description
Display your inputs history live on your stream, like on the training mode but all the time.
Viewers will be able to see it so they can understand how to do some techniques more easily (for example, Kage's instant cross-up EX Air Tastu or playing charge characters).

# How to set it up
On OBS, add a new browser source and copy the link generated. I recommend at least 200px wide.

If you wish to try it first before integrating it to OBS, just open the link directly on your browser and try it with your controller.

# Some more informations
As I can't optimize it for every controllers, if you don't use a PS4 controller, you can customize the commands then generate a link.

There's no tracker or anything on this application. Everything is done locally on your computer, no data is sent anywhere. No cookie or anything is used, the parameters are set through the link generated

# Having an issue or a suggestion ?
For now, only the controller which is considered the first one connected will work, so, if it doesn't work and you have multiple controllers connected, unplug them all, refresh your scene on OBS then plug your controller.

You can send an email at this address for any question or suggestion : its.nooosky@gmail.com
